### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze patterns from the data, enabling financial institutions to take immediate action to mitigate the risk. Institutions will benefit from my findings because they will learn which variables contribute most to fraudulent transactions. From there, they will be able to mitigate the risks in whether a transaction is fraudulent.

### Data Sources

Credit Card Fraud Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "cc_data" and "location_data" files, containing detailed information about credit card usage made by each customer.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL and Python Servers - Data Analysis
- Tableau -  Visualizing Reports

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

  In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection.
  2. Handling missing values.
  3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the credit card data to answer key questions, such as:

- Is there a correlation between transaction amount and city population?
- How many fraudulent transactions occurred in each category?
- How does the average transaction amount vary between different job roles?
- What is the statistical summary on amount and city population?
- What does a histogram plot look like on amount?
- What are the number of frauds by gender and category?
- What are the top 3 states by the highest number of transactions?

### Data Analysis
